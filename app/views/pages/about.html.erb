    <p>As a new developer, I have devoured information and training from every resource possible. I've worked alongside junior- and mid-level developers and have built my own projects (which you can find in my portfolio).</p>

    <p>I strive for perfection, and work hard to deliver a product that satisfies client's needs in regards to functionality and feel, delivered on time and on budget.</p>
